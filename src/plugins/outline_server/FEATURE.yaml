  The Outline Server plugin integrates the Outline Shadowsocks server
  (outline-ss-server) with VPP, providing high-performance censorship
  circumvention capabilities. This plugin enables VPP to run a complete
  Shadowsocks server with advanced features like multi-user support,
  per-user data limits, and Prometheus metrics.

  Key capabilities:
  - Seamless integration with VPP's plugin architecture
  - Full VPP CLI interface for server management
  - Binary API for programmatic control
  - Support for multiple listening ports with different configurations
  - Dynamic key management without service interruption
  - Real-time statistics and performance monitoring
  - Built-in security features including replay defense

  The plugin manages the outline-ss-server as a child process and provides
  a comprehensive management interface through VPP's native CLI and API,
  making it easy to deploy and manage Shadowsocks services as part of a
  VPP-based network infrastructure.
